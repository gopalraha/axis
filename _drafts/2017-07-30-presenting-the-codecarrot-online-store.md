Selling things online could be a tiring process – buy a domain, find an e-commerce platform or host your website, customise it, set up a payment processor + a ton of other painful tasks.

At Instamojo, we’re removing these roadblocks in your journey as an entrepreneur. We began by creating simple links for you to sell products, easy integrations and a competitive flat price.

Today, we’re going one step further with the launch of the first version of our online store. We’re giving thousands of merchants a whole new identity and a sparkling online presence. You don’t need a fancy tech team for this, so go ahead and start customizing your store now.

## What’s new in our store?

Instamojo’s online store is customizable, giving you the full power to showcase your unique identity. Make it beautiful, make it you.
