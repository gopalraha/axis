## How can you pique their interest?

**Use language that emphasizes desired results**

Your call-to-action must inspire immediate activity. Focus on powerful words addressing readers’ desires. Appeal to what they want, which is to get, have, feel, overcome, optimize, increase, boost, and improve!

**Identify motivating factors that provide “extras.”**

Who isn’t motivated by getting something for nothing? Money-back and price-matching guarantees instill confidence in your ability to deliver. Extras such as free shipping, support or training dispel apprehension. Loyalty or reward programs nurture customer relationships.

**Design for ease of reading and comprehension.**

You’ve already heard and read about the best approaches to website content readability and performance, so get to work. Start by working your way through this comprehensive checklist of 20 website design mistakes. Every item addressed is an incremental improvement.

## How can you gain their trust?

![How can you gain their trust?](dog-and-cat-together.jpg)

My first question when arriving at a new site is always, “Can I trust these folks?” That’s everyone’s first question — or it should be. Inspire confidence with a website that promotes trust. Display relevant third-party trust badges provided by vendors such as Verisign, BBB and PayPal.

<blockquote>
All sites can benefit from an SSL — both in the level of security provided and the positive impression garnered. If you don’t already have an SSL installed, get up to speed and get started.
</blockquote>

Drop names and impress readers with relevant existing clients from large, national brands to small, local businesses with existing reputations. My best name-dropping client? The gourmet pizzeria down the street. With more than 40 years in business locally, everyone in town knows who they are!

**Focus on the customer’s perspective**

Speak to your readers’ needs, and speak to them as an individual — not as one of the masses you hope will become customers. Nail down your unique selling proposition ahead of time to target your ideal audience. Then, convince readers how working with you will make their life better.

Nailing down your business niche ahead of time, and the needs associated with that niche, will help you target your ideal audience.

<div class="callout">
Focus on actual benefits rather than features.
</div>

It’s all about customers and their needs. Demonstrate how you can solve for a need, and highlight glowing client testimonials that tell a compelling story.

## How can you compel them to take action?

![Giving some action by hand](johannes-wredenmark-251375.jpg)

**Create a sense of urgency**

Nothing inspires action like FOMO (fear of missing out). Limited-time opportunities, sales, coupons, product availability — encourage action sooner rather than later.

**Make it easy for their questions to be answered**

Readers have questions. Show them you have answers. Provide a robust Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) page. Beyond the obvious topics, I recommend identifying questions you think readers are too embarrassed to call about for fear of looking stupid or naïve. Answer those first.

<div class="callout">
Provide your contact information early and often, with multiple avenues to contact you.
</div>

Even if your phone number and email are listed, all sites can benefit from a contact form. Plug-ins and embeddable options make it easy. Consider [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/), [JetPack](https://jetpack.com/) or [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

**Eliminate roadblocks in the selling process**

Yes, online shopping is easier than fighting mall crowds, but why make it more painful than it needs to be? Pay attention to small features that make your store easier to navigate and your products easier to evaluate. Consider sorting by price, recommendations of related products, a progress indicator while checking out, and easy-to-understand shipping options and policies.

How do you measure the success of your website?

![Keeping track of data and analyze it](keeping-track-of-data-and-analyze-it.jpg)

Keeping track of visitor behavior is critical to generating traffic and reaching goals. Identify improvement opportunities by learning as much as possible about your audience and how they navigate through your site.

**Google Analytics**

Google Analytics provides a wealth of information. There’s no good reason not to include a tool that’s free, collects data silently in the background, and provides endless opportunities for in-depth analysis.

**Heat maps**

Use heat maps to visualize how visitors are engaging with your site and which areas of a web page are most frequently scanned by visitors. Through tools such as [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/), [Kissmetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.com/), [Mouseflow](https://mouseflow.com/) and [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/), you can learn where visitors are clicking most, how far down the page they scroll before stopping, and where they are coming from in the first place.

Evaluating heat map data leads to changes that can optimize call-to-action placement, streamline page layout/design, maximize image effectiveness, and reduce cart abandonment. These analytical tools can help you create a better user experience, and enjoy higher conversion rates.
