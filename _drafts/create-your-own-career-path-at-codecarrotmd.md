We love change at CodeCarrot. Nothing is set in stone. You can define your working hours, shape your working space, and create your own career path. We do have some guidelines for each stage of your adventure with project management, but the actual career decisions are entirely up to you. So ask yourself: what makes you tick? And find your place in our team!

Of course, it’s up to you which path you will eventually choose. What’s important for us is that you follow your dreams and make them come true. Evolve, explore, and manage like a pro. Be a pro! [Check out the vacancies we currently offer]() and apply now!
