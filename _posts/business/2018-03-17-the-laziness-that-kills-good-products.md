Over the years, you start hearing some phrases that keep coming up over and over in product or design meetings. They can be indicative of laziness, disorganization, or a poor process — so it’s actually important to address them. Here is my collection of the phrases I’ve heard, and how you can respond.

**“Maybe we can A/B test it.”**
A/B tests consume a lot of time and effort. Do you really feel it’s worth investing that time? It may be a better use of our time to make a gut decision on this, or find proxy data that we can use now.

**“Let’s add that into the settings menu”**
How many of our core users will actually need this? Can we instead show this feature only when we think a user would actually need it?

**“Facebook/Apple/Google did it that way”**
Is it actually helpful to keep our designs consistent with Facebook here? If our users are truly expecting consistency, then that’s fine — but otherwise let’s think more about the right experience for our users.

**“We don’t have analytics for that.”**
Ok, so what’s the plan for filling that gap in our analytics?

**“Maybe we could build this feature idea later on.”**
No, it’s better to cut this altogether. We already have a ton of features in our backlog that are higher priority. It’s better to stay focused.

**“My friends were complaining about our app this weekend, and they recommended we change X, Y, and Z.”**
We can add that to our mental library of anecdotes to pull from, but let’s not change our decision making process so suddenly.

**“How about we trigger a notification to encourage our users to do X?”**
The world is getting fed up with notification spam. This will just get us blocked by the user. Let’s think a bit more about why they aren’t doing X.

**“We don’t want to constrain ourselves. We’re building this product for everyone.”**
Making tough design decisions is an order of magnitude more complex without a clear definition on a few types of users to target.

**“I think our users are going to like this.”**
Hey — you’re usually right, but in this instance, can you elaborate on how you know that?
