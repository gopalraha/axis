If you don't have a website for your business. You can get is [developed from Codecarrot](https://www.codecarrot.net/).

Your website is more than just a piece of web real estate. Properly built and maintained, a site can help you bring in more clients, more sales and greater earnings. It gives potential customers a way to explore what you have to offer, and you a way to sell your services to those who are looking for them. Your real estate website design is a dynamic representation of you, your team or your brokerage, and should be crafted with care and strategy.

When agents join a major brokerage firm — or even medium-sized or more localized brokerages — the onboarding package might include a provided agent website. Those joining small brokerages or going into business for themselves will usually be responsible for building their own websites.

Even if your brokerage does provide you with a website, there’s still a significant downside — your site now looks like 90,000 or so other sites (or perhaps even 200 local ones). How is anyone going to find you or tell you apart from the rest?

## What to include in your real estate website design?

A large part of shopping for a home these days is online research. People want as much information as possible before ever setting foot on a property. If you can make your real estate website a resource for potential buyers, you will simplify the process. At a minimum, your site should have the following elements to meet the needs of today’s home buyer.

### 1. Searchable listings

Some statistics show that 80 percent of all property shoppers search online when looking for a new home. If you have the listings right on your site, it will be easy for them to turn to you when they find the one they love.

### 2. Photos, photos and more photos

Along with being able to search for available properties, customers should be greeted by high-quality imagery the moment they land on your website. We’re talking full-page images that exhibit the beautiful details of the properties you sell.

<blockquote>
Show pictures of the available homes, pictures of properties you’ve sold, pictures of the neighborhoods in the area — show pictures of everything. And, more importantly, make it easy to view them.
</blockquote>

### 3. Prominent contact information

However you lay out your real estate website design, make sure your contact information is always visible on screen. In many cases, this means including a phone number in a sticky header, as well as the footer.

<div class="callout">
It’s also a good idea to have a clear and concise contact page that is accessible through the main navigation of the website.
