Conversion rates are one of the most popular and accurate KPIs in web apps. That’s why you want to keep them high. There are many reasons why conversion rates are low, and we usually associate them with design issues. That said, the reasons for poor conversion rates can go way beyond interfaces, colors and the content used. Solving the non-design issues mentioned in this article will [help you boost conversion rates and will also take less time, money and effort than redesign and implementation](/why-your-frontend-maintenance-costs-so-much).

## First impression is the last impression

One common reason for a low conversion rate is that people don’t like what they see when they land on your site or, even worse, they can’t find the information they need. If you’re getting traffic but no conversions, or have a high bounce rate on a page you think should keep visitors on your site, then it makes sense to troubleshoot site design issues first.

## You Don’t Know About Your Audience

When you’re thinking about how to improve your conversion rate, another issue to consider is whether you’re clear on who is your audience are. If you’re not marketing to the right set of people, then you’ll end up with a low conversion rate, and sales will decline.

## You Don’t React to Users Behaviour

There is only a short spam of time in which you have to react to a user’s behaviour. For example, if a users lands on a pricing page, send a targeted message about the pricing. Every user is expecting a reaction, and if the website doesn’t react, they think it’s broken and leave.

## You Don’t Support Your Users’ Browsers

Have you checked how your website works on browsers your visitors use? All the relevant data can be found in analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, and you should monitor these data on a regular basis to get most out of an analytics tool. You might be missing on many opportunities, if your website doesn’t display properly on a browser that the majority of your audience like.

## You Don’t Handle Errors Gracefully

One of the most common reasons for the users to leave your app is when a they have a buggy experience and there’s no information on what went wrong. Users would rather see that something went wrong and seeing no results and feeling abandoned.

## Your Web Page is Slow

According to [Aberden Group Report](https://www.aberdeen.com/research/5136/ra-performance-web-application/content.aspx), a 1-second delay in page load time equals 11 percent fewer page views, a 16-percent decrease in customer satisfaction, and a 7-percent loss in conversions.

The reason your web page loads slowly becuase you are [fetching too muching data on your page](#you-fetch-too-much-data-on-your-pages).

The website speed can substantially decrease the number of current and potential clients. If the website fails to load within expected time, they won’t hesitate and move to other site. These stats are ruthless but show that you can’t afford to keep your website slow.

## You Fetch Too Much Data on Your Pages

This piece advice is perfect for [Single Page Applications](/how-developing-spa-influenced-me-and-my-code), but might be applied to others too. Fetching the most important data for the users first and fetch the less important things later in the background.

For example, loading the comments later on once the main content is rendered. It won’t spoil the experience and will increase the website’s loading speed.

## Your Web App is Useless on Mobile

Have you ever used your web app on mobile? Have you used it on a device other than your own, which probably is the latest iPhone or a flagship Android device?

It's the best practice to make your application work with latest devices, but you should also your web app's performance on older devices with different operating systems to make sure it is also usable on those. Very often, the UX can be totally broken due to bad implementations.

## Your Page Is Distracting

For best results, make sure each page is focused on the core offer you want to make. That means removing navigation and other unnecessary elements on cart pages or landing pages. Check analytics for your pages to see if anything’s stopping people from converting.

## Call to Action Is Unclear

Is your call to action (CTA) clearly written and clearly visible? If not, you could be missing out on conversions. It’s crucial to have a single, clear call to action so visitors have no doubt about what to do next.

## Not Testing Enough

Testing is at the heart of conversion optimization, so it’s a no-brainer to test your entire website user flow to see where you can make improvements and boost conversions.

## Summary

A perfect design or code is not the only way you can increase conversion rates. There are a lot of things to consider, among them page load speed issues. You should make the overall performance and compatibility a priority when working on your products.
