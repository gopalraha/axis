## **76% of consumers say the most important factor in a website's design is "the website makes it easy for me to find what I want."**

![What is the most important factor in the design of a website?](https://i.imgur.com/PXlgVPe.png?2)

## **What does this mean for marketers?**

- **Don't** obsess over the visual design of your website
- **Do** obsess over the usability by your customers and prospects
- **Don't** worry if you or the CEO think your website design does not look pretty
- **Do** worry about the conversion rate of your website (Are people finding what they need and completing their tasks?)
- **Don't** use flash, heavy graphics, or tons of video
- **Do** use these things if it helps your customers get what they want from your website
- **Don't** reinvent the wheel when it comes to design and layout
- **Do** use a basic layout that will be familiar to your customers
- **Don't** differentiate with the design/functionality of your website
- **Do** differentiate your company by making it really easy for your customers to find what they want on your website
- **Test, test, test!** The only thing that matters is what your customers do on your website. Sit down with a potential customer, and watch them use your website. See if they can figure out how to get what they want; see if they can easily do the tasks you want your consumers to do. (e.g. "Show me how you would register for our free demo.")
