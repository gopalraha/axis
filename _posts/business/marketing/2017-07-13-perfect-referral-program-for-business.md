## What is a Referral Program?

A referral program is a marketing tool where you reward your customer to refer your business to a friend/colleague. A refer-and-earn program can help you multiply your business, raise brand awareness and increase your marketing ROI.

## Why Choose a Referral Program?

## How to Find the Right Referral Program for your Business

If you’re sold on the idea of getting a referral program for your business, here is the next step – finding the right referral program.

To understand what referral program would suit your business the best, ask yourself these questions:

* Who is my customer? What kind of incentive/gift would they enjoy?
* What will this referral program do for me?
* Will this program only help you get new customers or will it benefit existing customers too.

## Types of Referral Programs

Once you have your priorities straight about what your referral program will do for you, choose from the below programs:

## Implied Referrals

Implied referral is a non-tangible referral program, where you aren’t directly giving the customers an incentive but are requesting them to endorse your business.

For example, you request a client to keep a brochure or catalog in their office or home so that other people visiting your client can look at it and try it out.

This works for a nice service-related business like an interior decorator or a jewelry designer etc.

## Tangible Referrals

Tangible referral is a referral scheme where you offer a tangible incentive to your customer, which is not in the form of cash. For example: a buy one, get one offer; Bring a friend to an event or send a gift to your customer and ask them to share it with their friends.

Ideally, the product that you are promoting has your brand on it. This helps you improve brand awareness.

## Community Referrals

Community referral programs build emotion for your brand. In such a program, you partner with a non-profit organization and donate a certain part of the proceeds or donate every time a customer purchases something from your business.

## Direct Referrals

A direct referral rewards program is where an existing customer helps sign up another new customer and both get a reward. This is by far, the most popular form of referral program.
