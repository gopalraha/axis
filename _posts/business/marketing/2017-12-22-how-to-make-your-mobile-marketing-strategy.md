People are using mobile as an integral part of their day-to-day lives and as an online marketer, you need to get onboard. Your audience determines what marketing strategies you need to incorporate. What makes sense for one target base may not interact with the other, therefore you need to keep this in mind while formulating your mobile marketing strategy.

As per Google, nearly 60% of searches come directly from mobile devices. This number is huge and hence your content must be optimized for a seamless mobile experience.

To start with, conduct a small survey and ask people how they use their mobile. It will help you to formulate your strategies. Here are three simple questions which you should definitely ask in your survey:

* Which types of mobile devices do you use?
* Where do you access to content with your phone or tablet?
* What types of content do you consume on your mobile device?

The data you get from your survey will further guide you. Consider below-mentioned steps and boost your mobile marketing strategy like never before:

## Step 1: Define Your Target Audience

The first step is to identify your target audience and map its behavior. Most of the online businesses will have more than one set of audience. You need to define the demographics, behavior, and interests of your prospect target audience before starting any mobile marketing activity.

Identifying your target audience helps you:

* Determine which mobile channel makes sense for which audience base
* Determine what kind of content you need to create
* Set the tone and delivery strategies for your mobile messages
* Understand where your buyers get their information and how they want to consume it on a mobile platform

## Step 2: Understand the Customer Life-cycle

Now that you have identified your prospect target audience, you need to define their customer lifecycle. It will help you in determining the entire decision-making process during the purchase of your products or services. Through customer life-cycle, you can directly speak with your customers at any given point of engagement.

The process of customer lifecycle involves:

* Awareness
* Research
* Sale
* Feedback
* Advocacy

## Step 3: Define Your Goals

Once you have determined your target audience and mapped out its life cycle, you must define your goals. Making your mobile strategy should be a holistic part of your business goal and it should relate to the companyâ€™s overall business. The key to creating a successful mobile marketing strategy is to first identify what you are doing now for mobile engagement and then asking:

* Are you currently using responsive design in your marketing materials?
* Do you currently have a mobile app?
* Are you currently using push notifications?

This question enables you to define your goals.

## Step 4: Define Your KPIs

Set your KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) after you have defined your marketing goals. While there are large numbers of possible KPIs, you may consider customer engagement as the most crucial aspect.  It is one of the keyparametersr to measure the success of your mobile activity.

How is this measured? Well, below are some critical aspects which you can consider to define your KPIs

* Number of app downloads
* Total number of mobile users
* Contacts and new customers attributed to mobile
* Spend per new mobile customer
* Higher conversion rates
* Closed sales connected to mobile contacts
* Customer lifetime value of mobile users
* In app purchases

## Step 5: Integrate in Overall Strategy

Think about how your mobile marketing strategy fits into your overall marketing initiatives. Visit your marketing calendar to determine how other channels are communicating with your existing customers and prospect audience base. Deliver a coordinated customer experience across all of channels that your customers use.

Set the frequency of your communication if you are engaging in mobile notification of any kind. Also ensure that all your communications are in sync. Set a marketing calendar which records all your marketing activities taking place across channels at one place.

In order to communicate with your customers every day, you must include mobile as an important part of your marketing strategy. To create mobile campaigns that are engaging and compelling, you need to create a mobile strategy that shapes the state of your online business effectively.
