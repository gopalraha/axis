So you want to start a blog?

If you’re a writer, it makes perfect sense: You can use a blog to serve as your author platform, market your book or find new freelance writing clients.

But where do you begin? Though you’ve got the writing part down, the rest of the process can be overwhelming. Hosting, themes and all that other techy stuff can stand in your way for years.

Well, today is the day that ends. **We’re here to help you navigate every step of starting a blog, from choosing your domain name to publishing your first post**.

Here’s **how to start a blog** as a writer:

## 1. Pick a domain name

First things first: Where are people going to find you online? As a writer, you are your brand, so we recommend using some variation of your name. To check availability, simply visit the domain registrar website and search for the domain name you are looking for.

If none of the obvious options are available, try tacking a “writer” onto the end of your name, as in `codecarrotwriter.com`. You could also use a “.net” or “.biz” domain, but keep in mind that most people automatically type in “.com” before thinking of other endings.

You can, of course, opt for a creative blog name, but remember that your interests and target audience may change as the years go by. May be in future you plan to writer blog on other topic.

If you don't want to use a new brand name for your blogs, then go for your own name, because your name won’t change, no matter what you're blogging about.

## 2. Purchase a hosting package

Now that you’ve picked out your domain name, it’s time to choose a web host. Your hosting company does all the technical magic to make sure your site actually appears when people type your newly anointed domain name into their browser.

## 3. Coding and designing

Don't worry, you don't have to do the techy stuff of coding and designing, [we're here to do](https://www.codecarrot.net/) it.

To get started all you need is to visit [codecarrot.net](https://www.codecarrot.net/) and start a chat, one of our representative will happy to help you.

## 4. Start your email list

I know, I know — you haven’t even started posting blog and you're glad to do it.

Starting an [email list](/beginners-guide-to-starting-an-email-list) is a great way to bring traffic to your website, buys of my products and opportunities you never could expect.

Even if you don’t have anything to send, just start collecting email addresses. The best way to entice people to sign up is by offering a free ebook or resource.

## 5. Write

If you really want to start a blog, you’re going to need to… start blogging.

We recommend creating an editorial calendar — even if it’s just you blogging. It doesn’t have to be fancy; it can even be scribbled out in a notebook.

**What’s important is that you plan your posts in advance, so you can keep track of your ideas and stick to a schedule.** It’s also a chance to assess and tweak your content strategy. What do you want to write about? How will you draw the readers in?

Don’t forget you’re writing for the web, so your style should be different than if you were writing for print. Keep your tone conversational, use “you” phrases to speak to the reader and break up text with bullet points and sub-headers. Keep SEO in mind, but don’t make it the focus of your writing.

## 6. Promote, promote, promote

You’re almost there! Now that you’ve started writing, it’s time to get readers. And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but for many writers, this is one of the most surprisingly time-consuming aspects of blogging. Though it’d be nice if we could just write (that’s what we love to do, right?), it’s nicer to have people actually reading your work.

One of the best ways to attract new readers is guest blogging on more popular blogs. Social media is another great way to get more traffic to your new blog. In addition to sharing your posts and networking with fellow bloggers, make sure you’re constantly trying to grow your author following on social media.
