So where do I start?

Weâ€™ve already had a couple of meetings about the sites and weâ€™ve set out the technical and functional criteria. The design is down to me.

Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot recently about the process of design because to be honest Iâ€™m still searching for one that works.

Iâ€™ve designed a load of projects over the years with some half decent results along the wayâ€¦ but using only a very loose design process I normally grind and crash my way to the projectâ€™s conclusion. So Iâ€™m eager to find design process that works.

So after some thought Iâ€™ve come up with a five point design process plan.

### **1. Just think**

Put on some inspiring tunes and just think about your project in the loosest possible way (at this point anything goes, the crazier the ideas the better).

I sometimes find going for a run with some tunes for company gives me a ton of ideas. Thinking in bed before you go to sleep is quite thought-provoking too.

### **2. Look for inspiration**

Make a note of your initial ideas and with them in mind hit the internet. Scour the web for anything related to your ideas and bookmark anything that catches your eye. Do the same with your bookshelf, newspapers and magazines. One thing I find helps is looking at non design related literature as you can often stumble across an unexpected visual gem when youâ€™re least expecting it. Itâ€™s also useful to take a step back from current design trends when looking for inspiration as I sometimes find itâ€™s easy for a project to start looking a bit like everything else out there. Remember if you find that perfect bit of inspiration in the back of some old 80â€™s gatefold album sleeve you can bet your bottom dollar that no-one elseâ€™s design is going to look like yours.

### **3. Sketch out rough designs**

Spend some time sketching out your ideas in your notepad/sketchbook. Try and avoid jumping straight onto your computer (Iâ€™m guilty of this big time!).

I find going straight to your computer can give you a sort of â€˜design tunnel visionâ€™â€¦basically meaning itâ€™s easy to get stuck in a rut with your first design that wasnâ€™t really thought through.

### **4. Start designing proper**

So after sketching out a bunch of ideas you should have a much clearer idea of what direction you want to take your design. So designing in photoshop or xhtml/css etc should be a much easier process. Also once you feel confident with the route your taking in your design try not to get bogged down in minor details at this stage (Iâ€™m also guilty of this), you can do the the detail later when you happy with the bigger picture.

### **5. The devilâ€™s in the detail**

Hopefully now your photoshop and xhtml/CSS is going swimmingly and youâ€™re nearing the endâ€¦ well this is the time to pay attention to those small details as itâ€™s often the attention to detail that makes the difference between good and great. If thereâ€™s something nagging you about a certain part of your design and you sort of know you should revisit it but donâ€™t know if you can be bothered â€“ just do itâ€¦ Itâ€™ll be worth it in the end.

So what do you reckon? Is this a load of rubbish, is it just obvious?â€¦ or is there some value in it?
Does anyone have any thoughts or tips they could add? ðŸ™‚
