You may ask yourself why seek help updating your current website? Yes, your current website looks outdated compared to the competition but does a credible, compelling website design really matter?

A studies show a well-built website will generate better customer traffic and an improved user interface will increase conversion – generating new business at an exponential rate. But how? How can something as superficial as your company’s website design impact the success of a business? There are many reasons why a well designed website will attract your ideal customer and prompt dialogue with your firm.

## Navigation

Possibly the most important part of a website is the navigation. The navigation of a website can make or break a site, which is especially true for robust websites with many pages. Website navigation typically includes a navigation bar or list of labels that differentiate the pages of the website.

Good navigation should be easy to find and comprehend – making for quick and easy travel throughout the entire website.

## Brand Consistency

If your company has a logo and that logo is utilised frequently in print materials (i.e. business cards, pamphlets, letterheads, etc.), then the logo, logo/brand colours, brand messaging and imagery used for print must be carried over into the website design. It is important for your customers to be able to recognise your brand in all forms of communication so they associate your brand position and promise with your business.

## Reading Patterns and SEO

Most people are comfortable reading a web page the same way they read a book, from top to bottom, left to right. Web designers also take this into account when designing for a website. This will help get the message across more effectively for website visitors who could be current or potential customers.

Many people do not know that placing important information in these areas of a website also improves search engine optimization (SEO).

When you include important company-related keywords into the html-based text, search engines such as Google and Bing are able to crawl your website easily, increasing your search engine placement and giving your website and firm more overall visibility.

## Content

The content of your site literally communicates your company’s brand position and promise. There are other very important elements that are considered when a copywriter creates the content and the designer creates the complementary visual environment for the content.

Making the message short and to the point, yet warm and welcoming (depending on the industry) helps the reader to remember the message easier. Also, when there is too much text on a page, the page becomes visually cluttered making it more difficult for a reader to physically read the page, let alone remain interested in reading the page.

Insert the text into their design, which typically includes plenty of negative space. This empty space lets the reader’s eyes rest so they do not tire of reading.

Let’s look at some reasons why we love web design so much—and some benefits to your business what will make you love it as well.

**1. Good Sites Increase Customer Conversions**

If you have a well-designed site for your business, you’ll get more customer conversions.  This is because good sites lead customers to what they’re supposed to do without distraction or fluff.  Whatever action you want your customers to take when they reach your page, you can guide them to that action with elements of web design.  Just make sure your site is easy to navigate and don’t waste your customers’ time.

**2.  Sites Can Help Your Branding**

If you have a shoddy looking website, it’s going to hurt your brand. A scammy-looking website will drive customers away.  On the other hand, an elegant site can help people connect with your branding.  Creative but simple websites send the message that your brand is useful, modern, and service-based.  Having a user-friendly page makes potential customers more likely to reach out or trust you enough to contact you.  Your site directly reflects your branding, but don’t let that scare you.  Instead, realise the potential it provides—you have ultimate control over how visitors perceive your company.

**3.  Responsive Web Design Helps You Reach More Customers**

More and more users do business on their mobile phones these days. If you take advantage of responsive web design, your business can have a new set of customers. You can gear business towards those people who aren’t always near a computer.  Using web design effectively allows you to capitalize on the technology of the time to gain all the customers you can.

**4.  Beauty And Functionality**

Artwork is beautiful, but is it always functional? Websites can be both, which is another reason we love them so much.  Web design is an amazing blend of logic and creative thought. It’s easy to forget how much we need and appreciate good sites until we see a bad one. Practical aesthetics allow websites to turn emotional appeal into solid action.
