`form_tag` and `form_for` are soft deprecated and they will be replaced by `form_with` in the future. If you want to know more about `form_with` then you can peruse the original [DHH’s proposal](//github.com/rails/rails/issues/25197), check the [pull request](//github.com/rails/rails/pull/26976/files) in which it was implemented, check the [API documentation](//api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_with) and play with it in a test project.

Or, continue reading this post in which I explain differences between `form_tag`, `form_for` and `form_with` with code samples.

<div class="callout">
One syntax to rule them all
</div>

Previously when you wanted to create a form, but you did not have an underlying model for it, then you used `form_tag`.

```
<%= form_tag users_path do %>
  <%= text_field_tag :email %>
  <%= submit_tag %>
<% end %>
```

When you had a model, then you used `form_for`.

```
<%= form_for @user do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :email %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

As you can see, we use form builder field helpers with `form_for` but we don’t do that with `form_tag`. So the syntax for both forms is different.

This isn’t the case with `form_with`, because we use form builder all the time.
`form_with` without a model:

```
<%= form_with url: users_path do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :email %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

`form_with` with a model:

```
<%= form_with model: @user do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :email %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

When you set the `model` argument then `scope` and `url` are automatically derived from it. This behaviour is similar to `form_for`.

<div class="callout">
Automatic ids and classes are gone
</div>

`form_tag` and `form_for` generate automatic ids for form fields. `form_for` does it also for forms.

```
<%= form_for User.new do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :email %>
<% end %>
```

Generates:

```
<form class="new_user" id="new_user" action="/users" ...>
  ...
  <input type="text" name="user[email]" id="user_email" />
</form>
```

With `form_with` you have to specify all of your ids and classes manually:

```
<%= form_with model: @user do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :email, id: :email, class: :email %>
<% end %>
```

Generates:

```
<form action="/users" ...>
  ...
  <input type="text" name="user[name]" />
  <input id="email" class="email" type="text" name="user[email]" />  </form>
```

Do not forget to specify ids for form fields if you want to make labels work.

```
<%= form_with model: @user do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name, id: :user_name %>
<% end %>
```

<div class="callout">
Form id and class attributes aren’t wrapped anymore
</div>

Before:

```
<%= form_for @user, html: { id: :custom_id, class: :custom_class } do |form| %>
<% end %>
```

After:

```
<%= form_with model: @user, id: :custom_id, class: :custom_class do |form| %>
<% end %>
```

<div class="callout">
Form fields don’t have to correspond to model attributes
</div>

Before:

```
<%= form_for @user do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :email %>
  <%= check_box_tag :send_welcome_email %>
<% end %>
```

After:

```
<%= form_with model: @user, local: true do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :email %>
  <%= form.check_box :send_welcome_email %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Please note, that `send_welcome_email` will be scoped to `user` in controller parameters in the latter example:

```
params[:user][:send_welcome_email]
```

Therefore I would probably still use `check_box_tag` instead of `form.check_box` if I needed to.

<div class="callout">
All forms are remote by default
</div>

This change is the most exciting to me. All forms generated by `form_with` will be submitted by an XHR (Ajax) request by default. There is no need to specify remote: true as you have to with `form_tag` and `form_for`.

I like this feature, because it sends a message. Thanks to Turbolinks, (almost) all GET requests are XHR requests by default. And thanks to `form_with` this can become a reality for forms, too. You just need to do a little bit of work (create a JavaScript response template) and you can eliminate all full page refreshes.

However, if you want to disable remote forms then you can do it with `local: true`.

```
<%= form_with model: @user, local: true %>
<% end %>
```

<div class="callout">
Let’s use form_with since now and never look back!
</div>

I did not cover everything in this post, but it should be enough to get you started with `form_with` so you don’t have to use `form_tag` and `form_for` anymore (they will be removed anyway). Also, [read the documentation for `form_with`](//api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_with).
