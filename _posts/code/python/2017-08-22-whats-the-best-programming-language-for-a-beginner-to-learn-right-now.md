If you’re new to coding, you may be asking yourself: where is the best place to start? You’ve heard the names of countless programming languages flying around, but it’s hard to know which one is right for you. There are a few different approaches you can take to choosing your first language. Choose a language that sounds the most interesting to you so you can work on a project that is going to drive your learning and progress. But, if you aren’t sure what type of projects work for you, it’s worth noting that there is one particularly popular language that’s in high-demand and coincidently it’s also very approachable and digestible for beginners.

## So which beginner language is it?

While we attended conferences throughout the year, we asked developers we met – some who knew over 20 programming languages – which languages they would recommend for beginners and aspiring developers. Overwhelmingly, one language dominated all of their answers: Python. 

As developer, we can described, *“Python is really great for a beginner because it’s not verbose. Once you start learning it lets you play with a lot of things quickly.”* The benefit of this for a beginner is that it won’t take you long to grow your skills and see the results in your work.

We then took the conversation one step further and were curious what our expert teachers would say. So we asked a few of them which languages they would recommend for an absolute beginner. Their answer? You guessed it. Python. It reads like pseudocode. You can sit down and read it, which is great for a beginner.

So the overall winner: Python. If you’d like to know more about Python – including the fact that it was named after Monty Python in the late 1980s – and what you can do with it, [check out this great article](/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero) that explains exactly that.
