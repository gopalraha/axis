Job searching is incredibly stressful, daunting and overwhelming. In order to get the interview, you need a resume that enhances as well as emphasizes your skills to the prospective employer.

## What constitutes the perfect resume website?

It is a fact that employers spend 5-7 seconds reviewing your resume. One mistake, and you’re out of the interviewing game. So, how do you grab the reader’s attention? It’s a simple show vs. tell mentality.

Looks are everything when it comes to resume website. In that very short amount of time employers spend glancing at your resume website, they have already judged you before seeing you and certainly before speaking to you. If you are a terrible communicator on paper, chances are, your interviewing skills will not be any better. Do you think an employer is willing to take that risk and interview you?

The first glance at a candidate’s resume is similar to the first glance on a first date. How would you prepare for a first date? You would shower, groom yourself and dab on some cologne or perfume to ensure you smell as fabulous as you look. First dates are all about first impressions. In the resume writing world, no one cares about who you are on the inside. LOOKS MATTER when it comes to your resume. Accept it and abide by it.

There are three (3) top areas to focus on in helping you write the perfect resume and we want to share them with you. Are you ready?

**Here they are:**
1.  Branding and targeting
2.  Professional experience
3.  Organization and layout

## Branding and targeting

Your resume is your branding. The perfect resume website will target yourself for the right position and industry. The perfect resume website begins with a succinct professional summary that summary provides an introduction to the reader of who you are. Think of it as the catchy summary on the insert of a book. In marketing your resume website, you have to be creative and collaborative. Notice I did not say “objective.” If you are using an “objective” in your resume, you are likely getting thrown into the “no-interview” pile.

This may come as a total shock to you, but employers know your objective. If they didn’t, you wouldn’t be sending in your resume to their company. They know you want a job with their company doing exactly what the job description states.

Ask yourself, what special skills do you have that make YOU different from the next person?

Remember this is for a job interview, not for a Friday night date.

Now that you know that, emphasize your skills and potential.

## Professional experience

Responsibilities are great, but an employer wants relevant and results-driven experience that will separate you from the other candidates.

The most important thing to remember is that you are not writing your resume for you to look at and admire all of your accomplishments. You are writing your resume for your audience. You must tailor towards the industry and include specific key achievements and value that you bring to the job and company.

## Organization and layout

Sophistication is the theme when it comes to the organization and layout of your resume website. How your resume looks is just as important as what it says. If the resume does not catch the reader’s eye with a strong organization and layout, then it will certainly be thrown into the “no interview” pile. The headings must stand out in plain view and at first glance. Your job titles should also stand out. Descriptions should begin with strong action verbs.

Now that I’ve provided you these three (3) basic, but important, tips on how to write the perfect resume, I want to give you the lowdown on why you should hire a certified professional resume writer to help you craft that perfect resume.


**Do I really need a Resume Website?**

Now we have come down to the very important question that you are still asking: Do I really need a Resume Website? **(Read this article also: [Why Should I have a Website?](/why-should-i-have-a-website/)** We recognize and acknowledge that it is hard to write about yourself and detail your own work history in a methodical way. Re-evaluating your resume and determining whether it needs to be overhauled by a resume website is easy.

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1.  Does your resume properly highlight your accomplishments?
2.  Does your resume contain a strong organizational framework of your skills?
3.  Does your resume provide you with a targeted and focused branding?
4.  Does your resume contain the right keywords that align with the job position?

The above questions are the most common elements that employers seek out when reviewing your resume. If you have answered “no” to any of those four (4) questions, now ask yourself these three (3) honest questions:

1.  Is your current resume working for you?
2.  Are you sending out your resume day after day with no response?
3.  Are you getting calls for interviews with companies that offer your dream job?

If you have answered “yes” to any of these questions, it is highly recommended that you have your resume immediately reviewed and written by a certified professional who knows what it takes to have your resume read by the prospective employer and grab his/her attention in those 5-7 seconds.

Let **CodeCarrot help you take your career to the next level by crafting the perfect resume website** for you so that you can get the highest paying job in your field.
