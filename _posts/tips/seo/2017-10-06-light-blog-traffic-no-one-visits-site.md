If you’ve ever clicked a link to a new website only to watch your web browser sputter and stall, you know that a slow website is a pain. In fact, when websites take a long time to load, some visitors cut and run.

Without a doubt, the appearance of your site is critical, and having quality content is imperative. But site speed makes the first impression — both with search engines and potential customers.

## Site speed: A primer

There are several reasons why site speed matters. Faster sites provide a better experience for your site visitors and customers. And faster sites might actually get more traffic, because the algorithms that power search engines like Google consider [speed-based performance metrics](/google-counts-site-speed-as-ranking-factor).

Terms to know:

* **Page speed**, sometimes referred to as **load time:** the amount of time (in seconds) it takes a specific page to go from initiation (i.e., visitor clicking on link) to all page content being fully loaded in the visitor’s browser window.
* **Site speed:** similar to page speed, but this takes into account multiple pages on a site.
* **Search engine:** a website (e.g., Google) that uses software to identify keywords on other sites.

Modern search engines aren’t just interested in keywords and links; they are designed to deliver an exceptional user experience. That’s why website optimization should be part of your SEO strategy as well.

<blockquote>
Think of your website as a virtual welcome mat for your business.

Nearly half (47 percent) of consumers expect sites to load in just a couple seconds. In fact, page abandonment increases with page load time. In other words, the slower your website is, the more likely visitors are to leave your site without exploring more content (or buying anything).

**Pro tip:** Avoid creating huge pages on your website. Consider splitting your content into multiple, smaller pages if possible.

## If you remember one thing about site speed …

As a small business owner, you might not think twice about the speed of your website. You might not care about the speed of your site, as long as it looks pretty good. But guess what? Google cares about the performance of your site. And potential customers — most of whom are accessing the web from their mobile phones — don’t have time to wait around.

<blockquote>
If you’re going to bother with a website, you need one that is fast, modern and designed for mobile devices.
</blockquote>

If you have doubts about your existing site, try out the user experience yourself on a variety of devices. If you like numbers, test your own site on Lighthouse.
