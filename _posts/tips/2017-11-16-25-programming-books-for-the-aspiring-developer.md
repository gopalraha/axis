Whether you’re learning to code online, at a bootcamp, or in-person, there’s one supplementary resource that we recommend to accompany your learning: books. But with so many programming books to choose from (a Google search brings up over 12 million related results) how do you know which ones to choose?

We decided to do some crowdsourcing and asked our awesome community on Facebook and Twitter: If there was one programming book you’d recommended, what would it be? We got lots of great responses and after sorting through them pulled together the top 25 *(listed in no particular order)*.
